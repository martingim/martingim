# Master's Thesis
In my master's thesis I compared numerical simulations with experiments from a physical wave tank of regular Stokes waves.
## Basilisk
I use two different methods of implementing a piston style wave maker in Basilisk. 
- Setting the velocity on the boundary
- A moving piston by setting the velocity inside the piston area at every time step

https://github.com/martingim/master/tree/main/matlab/PIV_basilisk contains the scripts and functions I used for perfroming PIV of images of Stokes waves. And also the for the visualization of the Basilisk results and comparison with PIV.
