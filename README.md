# [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/martingim/master)
In my master's thesis I compared numerical simulations with experiments from a physical wave tank of regular Stokes waves.
I use two different methods of implementing a piston style wave maker in Basilisk. 
- Setting the velocity on the boundary
- A moving piston by setting the velocity inside the piston area at every time step
